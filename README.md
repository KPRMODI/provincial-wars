What did you build?

I built a game that simulates a game known as territorial.io, with the player being able to expand on a grid system with AI that also expands. It utilizes a resources system which replenishes over time.


What language(s) or tools did you use?

I used HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I also consistently used the debugger and terminal for errors the AI made. Sometimes I would use control i to find certain variables as 
there was 400 + lines of code.

Which AI tools did you use, and how?

I used Gemini and Chat GPT mainly, asking it for an outline of the code at first and then asked for improvements and debugging to further build the app. I had to manually copy the text so the AI wouldnt forget the code each time and give me something different.

What did you do versus what AI helped with?

The only thing I did was switch some fixed valeus the Bot gave. For example, the amount of resources and land the bots and player had, I changed them to be in larger increments so the game would go by faster.

What’s one thing you’re proud of?

I was proud of the fact that I was able to constantly ask the AI to debug issues as it sometimes had a problem understanding what was wrong in the code. Though I had some problems in the code, I asked the AI to debug about 80% of the problems.

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?

I'd improve the quality of the game like more features and things to do as there wasnt much to do after all of the tiles on the grid were taken. I had issues with time due to alot of the time I had being used for debugging.
